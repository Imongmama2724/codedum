My core values and beliefs are courage, peacefulness, and respect. Observing my peers and colleagues today, I can say that courage is one of the values that is often underappreciated by this generation. Many are afraid of being judged, which prevents them from taking risks. That’s why I’ve embraced courage as a core value in my life.

Peacefulness is another core value that enhances my enjoyment of life. Instead of allowing myself to be in a bad mood, I rely on my personal mantra: “If things go your way, it’s God’s guidance; if not, then it’s God’s protection.” This mantra helps me remain calm and rational.
